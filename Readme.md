_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abstract</span>-_ Cryptography is a means of using codes to protect information and communications so that only those who are supposed to read and process it; may do so. Knowledge of ciphers is said to have been acquired by the Ancient Greeks and used for military purposes. Affine cipher uses alpha-numeric conversions and principles of matrix inversion to encrypt and decrypt data.
